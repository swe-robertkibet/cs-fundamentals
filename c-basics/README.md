# C Programming Basics

This week introduced fundamental C programming concepts, marking the transition from visual programming in Scratch to text-based programming. I learned core syntax, basic I/O operations, and control structures.

## Skills Learned

- **Variables and Data Types**: `int`, `string`, `char`, variable declaration and initialization
- **Input/Output**: `printf()` for output, `get_string()`, `get_int()` for user input
- **Control Structures**: `if/else` conditionals, `for` and `while` loops
- **Functions**: Creating custom functions, parameters, return values
- **Basic Debugging**: Using `printf()` for debugging, understanding compiler errors

## Key Projects

### Hello Programs
- `hello_interactive.c` - Interactive greeting program using user input
- `hello_root.c` - Basic hello world program

### Loop Practice
- `meow.c`, `meow_loop.c`, `meow_for.c` - Different approaches to repetition
- `meow_function.c`, `meow_advanced.c` - Function abstraction and parameters

### Pattern Generation
- `mario_simple.c` - Simple hash pattern printing
- `mario_grid.c` - More complex grid patterns with nested loops

### Practical Applications
- `calculator.c` - Basic arithmetic operations with user input
- `compare.c` - Comparing values with conditionals

## How to Run

Compile any program using:
```bash
make program_name
./program_name
```

Example:
```bash
make hello_interactive
./hello_interactive
```

## Reflections

The transition from Scratch's visual blocks to C's text syntax was challenging at first. I struggled with semicolons, curly braces, and remembering exact function names. Debugging became more complex without visual cues, but I learned to read compiler error messages and use `printf()` statements to track program flow.

## Future Work

I plan to revisit these basics when working on more complex projects, especially the function concepts which will be crucial for larger programs.
