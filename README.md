# CS50 Programming Fundamentals

A comprehensive collection of programming examples and exercises covering fundamental computer science concepts from Harvard's CS50 course.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by topic areas rather than chronological weeks, making it easy to navigate and find specific programming concepts:

### 📁 **c-basics/**
Core C programming fundamentals including variables, loops, functions, and basic I/O operations.

### 📁 **arrays/**
Array manipulation, string handling, character processing, and command-line arguments.

### 📁 **algorithms/**
- `sorting/` - Various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, etc.)
- `searching/` - Search implementations and phonebook examples
- `recursion/` - Iterative vs recursive approaches to problem solving

### 📁 **memory/**
Memory management concepts including pointers, malloc/free, memory allocation, and debugging with Valgrind.

### 📁 **data-structures/**
Advanced data structures including linked lists, binary search trees, hash tables, and tries.

### 📁 **python/**
Python implementations demonstrating language transition and higher-level programming concepts.

## CS50 Week → Topic Mapping

For transparency and educational context, here's how the original CS50 weekly structure maps to these topic-based folders:

- **Week 1 (C Basics)** → `c-basics/`
- **Week 2 (Arrays)** → `arrays/`
- **Week 3 (Algorithms)** → `algorithms/`
- **Week 4 (Memory)** → `memory/`
- **Week 5 (Data Structures)** → `data-structures/`
- **Week 6 (Python)** → `python/`

## Additional Resources

- `resources/` - Original lecture transcription files
- `docs/` - Additional documentation and guides

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Low-level programming** with C
- **Memory management** and pointer manipulation
- **Algorithm design** and complexity analysis
- **Data structure** implementation and usage
- **Problem decomposition** and debugging
- **Language transition** from C to Python

## Usage

Each folder contains working C programs that can be compiled and run. Most programs require the CS50 library for compilation.

Example compilation:
```bash
make program_name
./program_name
```
