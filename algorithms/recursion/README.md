# Recursion vs Iteration

Recursion and iteration are two approaches to solving repetitive problems in programming. **Recursion** involves a function calling itself to break a problem into smaller subproblems, often making the code more elegant and easier to understand for tasks like tree traversal or factorial calculation. However, it can be less efficient due to higher memory usage from maintaining multiple function calls on the call stack.

**Iteration**, on the other hand, uses loops (like `for` or `while`) to repeat tasks, generally consuming less memory and running faster because it avoids the overhead of recursive calls. While recursion emphasizes simplicity and clarity in certain cases, iteration is usually preferred for performance and control in large or performance-critical tasks.
